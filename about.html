        <h2>What is Space Debris</h2>
        <p>Space debris, or orbital debris, is any man made object that is no longer functional within Earth’s orbit. This includes objects such as decommissioned satellites, rocket boost stages, particles from chemical and liquid based propulsion systems, and the like. The debris environment increases in orbital matter through collisions within orbital planes.</p>

        <h2>Why is this Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>The answer to that is simple-collisions. Hundreds of collisions persistently happening, creating more and more debris as time goes on, and the fact of the matter is, for some of these satellites and fragments, they would not reach the amount of atmospheric drag necessary to fall back into the atmosphere for many years—long enough to pose a threat to current satellite operations. Did you know that small fragments the only the size of paint chips could cause quarter sized holes in structures in space? Well--There are an estimated 500,000 fragments below .4 inches, and 20,000 orbital debris objects above .4 inches.</p>
        <p>At any given moment on any given day, we could experience a catastrophic collision that could spark an unstoppable and insurmountable chain reaction between debris within orbital planes, what would make them impossible to inhabit with new technology.</p>

        <h2>How Does This Apply to Everyone?</h2>
        <p>Depending on which orbital plane this occurs, it could mean no more satellite television signal. It could knockout all internet access; which would make almost any technological usage nearly impossible. Cell phones? They use satellites for not only service and data, wifi, but also guidance and navigation. There is a plethora of possible outcomes that could drive our systems into a horrendous setback within daily life as well as within advancements in our society.</p>
